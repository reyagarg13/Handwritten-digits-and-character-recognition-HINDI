# Handwritten-digits-and-character-recognition-HINDI

This project focuses on recognizing handwritten characters and digits from the Devanagari script using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Devanagari, used in languages like Hindi and Marathi, poses unique challenges due to handwriting variability and script complexity. This project provides an automated solution for transcription and digitization.
